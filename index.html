	<h3>My Hobbies </h3>
	<ol>
	<li>My hobbies are reading books and working out. Along with this, I also like cooking. </li>
	<li>I usually spend my leisure time reading books or playing badminton. I like reading new and trending novels and my favourite genres include suspense, horror and thriller novels.Being a voracious reader, I believe that I have a strong vocabulary and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from my passion for reading books.</li>
	<li>I have a pet dog named Cookie and spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do.</li>
	<li>I also love to travel and I often plan trips with my family. But solo travelling gives me the bliss that I crave for. Every year I look forward to exploring new places and catching up on some lifetime memories.</li>
	<li>I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world. I started learning Arabic online and I have already cleared the beginner level. I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Arabic words and watching Arabic movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.“</li> 
	<li>My favourite hobby is<b> travelling </b>because I love discovering new cities and places around the world. I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. I love friends’ trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.</li>
	<li>My best hobby<mark> is meditating and spending my free time at meditation retreats</mark>. I think it has really helped me understand my mind and its complexities and in ensuring a better mental wellbeing.</li>
